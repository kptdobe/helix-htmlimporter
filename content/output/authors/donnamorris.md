## Donna Morris, Chief Human Resources Officer & Executive Vice President, Employee Experience

“Disrupt or be disrupted” is Donna Morris’ rallying cry. From abolishing Adobe’s annual performance reviews, to dramatically expanding its family leave policy and, most recently, achieving global gender pay parity across all 32 countries where Adobe has employees, she has set the industry agenda making Adobe a great place to work. Donna believes that people strategies empower successful business outcomes, and with Adobe being an IP-based company, people are its most important asset. In her role as Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO) & Executive Vice President of Employee Experience, she leads all aspects of human resources, real estate and security operations globally. Under her leadership, Adobe’s workforce has increased by 226% to more than 20,000 employees and its real estate/facilities presence has grown to more than 75 locations around the globe.
